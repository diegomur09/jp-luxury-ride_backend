### 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Test Square Payments** (recommended test amounts):
   - `$0.01` - Successful payment test
   - `$0.02` - Declined payment test  
   - `$0.05` - Card error test

2. **Frontend Integration:**
   ```javascript
   // Add to your React/Next.js app
   import { PaymentForm, CreditCard } from 'react-square-web-payments-sdk';
   
   <PaymentForm
     applicationId="sq0idp-k7r7J89fSLXm9WRTWpQa3g"
     locationId="LRXBWN7FKVJDB"
     cardTokenizeResponseReceived={handlePayment}
   >
     <CreditCard />
   </PaymentForm>
   ```

3. **Monitor Transactions:**
   - Square Dashboard: https://squareup.com/dashboard
   - Your payments will appear under **Transactions** → **Payments**

### 💡 **Production vs Development:**

Since you're using **production credentials**, all payments will be **real charges**. For testing:

- Use small amounts (like $0.01)  
- Test with your own cards
- Set up sandbox credentials if you need extensive testing

### 🔒 **Security Notes:**

- ✅ All credentials stored securely in GitHub Secrets
- ✅ Production environment properly configured
- ✅ Location verified and active
- ✅ Credit card processing enabled

**🎉 Your Square payment system is live and ready to accept customer payments!**
