## üí° Cost Optimization Strategies

### Immediate Optimizations (0-30 days)

#### 1. Reserved Instances

```
RDS Reserved Instance (1 year): 40% savings
ElastiCache Reserved (1 year): 35% savings
Potential Savings: $100-200/month
```

#### 2. S3 Intelligent Tiering

```
Auto-move old files to cheaper storage classes
Potential Savings: 30-70% on storage costs
```

#### 3. Lambda Optimization

```
- Right-size memory allocation
- Use Provisioned Concurrency strategically
- Implement connection pooling
Potential Savings: 25-40% on compute costs
```

### Medium-term Optimizations (30-90 days)

#### 1. CloudFront Caching Strategy

```
- Aggressive edge caching for static content
- API response caching for 1-5 minutes
Potential Savings: 50-80% on bandwidth costs
```

#### 2. Database Optimization

```
- Read replicas for query distribution
- Connection pooling with RDS Proxy
- Database query optimization
Potential Savings: 20-30% on database costs
```

#### 3. Auto Scaling Configuration

```
- Lambda concurrent execution limits
- RDS Aurora Serverless for dev/staging
- Spot instances for batch processing
Potential Savings: 30-50% on compute during low traffic
```

### Long-term Optimizations (90+ days)

#### 1. Multi-Region Strategy

```
- Primary region: us-east-1 (cheapest)
- Secondary region: us-west-2 (disaster recovery)
- Cross-region replication for critical data
Additional Cost: 25-30% but provides redundancy
```

#### 2. Serverless Aurora

```
- Pay per request for database
- Auto-scaling based on traffic
- Good for variable workloads
Potential Savings: 50-90% during low traffic periods
```
